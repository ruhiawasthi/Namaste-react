2) Diffrence b/w libary & Framework.

-> Both the framework vs library is precoded support programs to develop complex software applications. However, libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.

-> A framework provides a pre-defined structure and dictates how your code should be organized, controlling the overall flow of your application.

->A library offers specific functions or tools that you can use in your code as needed, but you have more control over your application's structure and flow.

3) What is CDN? Why do we use it?
-> The globally distributed nature of a CDN means reduce distance between users and website resources. Instead of having to connect to wherever a websiteâ€™s origin server may live, a CDN lets users connect to a geographically closer data center. Less travel time means faster service.

4) Why is React known as React?

-> React is aptly named because: It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

5) What is crossorigin in script tag?
-> The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

6) What is diference between React and ReactDOM.
-> React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM. Think again. As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM.

7) What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
-> In development mode, we can enable and utilize React developer tools, devtools profiler, debugging environment attached with source code. We can utilize various functionalities such as Hot Module Replacement, diagnostics so that development environment will help to debug code.

-> In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.

8)What is async and defer?
-> When you load a web page there is two things happens in your browser 1) HTML parsing 2)fetching the script and  loading  the script line by line. 
let's see 2 cases :

-> Async scripts are executed as soon as the script is loaded, so it doesn't guarantee the order of execution (a script you included at the end may execute before the first script file )

-> Defer scripts guarantees the order of execution in which they appear in the page.
